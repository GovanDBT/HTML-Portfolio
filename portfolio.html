    <h3>App that measures Carbon Emission (2023)</h3>
    <p>In 2023, i took part in IBM's global challenge who's theme was sustainable tech where we were tasked with coming up with tech solutions while applying IBM AI tools that could fight climate change, reduce food crisis, improve supply of clean water to communities, etc. For my project i decided to come up with an app that could give users information about the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, measure their carbon emission and get assistant from an AI tool called Watson Assistant.

    <h3>Student Internship website (2023)</h3>
    <p>During my third year in school in my software engineering class, we were tasked with building a student internship registration system for Computer Science students that could allow students to register for an internship anywhere anytime, view a catalog of available internship, apply for internship, submit log-books and report and select regions they want to apply for internship for. We built the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP as well as SQL to build the database and MySQL to manage the database.</p>

    <h3>Real-Estate Management System (2022)</h3>
    <p>For my Database Concept Management class, we were tasked with building a real-estate system that could allow users to register their property for sale or rent. The system could show the users the number of people interested in buying or renting their property, form a contract with the potential buyer, make bookings, etc. The system was built using Java and SQL to build the Database and MySQL to manage the Database.</p>

    <h3>Gaborone City Crime locating website (2021)</h3>
    <p>For my System Programming class during my second year we were tasked with building a website that could help keep track of crime and identify crime hot-spots in the city of Gaborone. In our website we implemented a Map from Goggle Maps that users can use to see their locations, see places were a crime like theft, burglary, robbery, trafficking, arson, grand-theft or homicide took place, see when the crime was committed, inform users that a crime took place near them, and could even identify to users road accidents that occurred near them. The website was meant to help users avoid places that were potential dangerous and see the growth of crime in their region. We used HTML, CSS and PHP for the project. Although i would say the project was not well built as it was our first time working on something this complicated and only had a week to complete and submit it ðŸ˜…, we did manage to get it done and working to some extent.</p>
